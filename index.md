# About Me

My general research focus is on generative models for biomelecular design - with particular focus on functional protein design conditioned on immune system modulation. I aim to incorporate statistical learning, probablistic modelling and biological reasoning into physics informed machine learning models. My experimental focus is on screening techniques for designed and random libraries (yeast surface display, cDNA display, etc) and leveraging high throughput methods for model reinforcement. 

I am currently a Visiting Researcher in Stanford's [Protein Engineering group](http://www.proteindesign.org/) under Dr Possu Huang while completing my MSc Statistics at ETH Zürich. 

I was fortunate enough to be a member of [Dr Valentina Boeva's Computational Cancer Genomics group](https://boevalab.inf.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zürich, where I worked on antibody design models and transcription factor binding prediction. Prior to my Master's, I was at the London School of Economics and Political Science studying Actuarial Science.
