# About Me

I am a visiting researcher in Possu Huang's Protein Engineering lab at Stanford while completing my MSc Statistics at ETH ZÃ¼rich. My research focus is on generative models for protein design - particularly conditioned on functional properties. I try to incorporate statistical learning and biological reasoning into physics informed modelling.
