# About Me

I am a visiting researcher in [Dr Possu Huang's Protein Engineering lab](http://www.proteindesign.org/) at Stanford while completing my MSc Statistics at ETH Zürich. My research focus is on generative models for protein design - particularly conditioned on functional properties. I try to incorporate statistical learning and biological reasoning into physics informed modelling. 

I was fortunate enough to be a member of [Dr Valentina Boeva's Computational Cancer Genomics group](https://boevalab.inf.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zürich, where I worked on antibody design models and transcription factor binding. 

If you are interested in chatting ML, biology, statistics or anything else - reach out!
