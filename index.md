# About Me

I am currently completing my MSc Statistics at ETH Zürich while also a Visiting Researcher in Stanford's [Protein Engineering group](http://www.proteindesign.org/) under Dr Possu Huang. My research focus is on generative models for protein design - particularly conditioned on functional properties. I aim to incorporate statistical learning, probablistic modelling and biological reasoning into physics informed machine learning models. 

I was fortunate enough to be a member of [Dr Valentina Boeva's Computational Cancer Genomics group](https://boevalab.inf.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zürich, where I worked on antibody design models and transcription factor binding prediction. Prior to my Master's, I was at the London School of Economics and Political Science studying Actuarial Science.
