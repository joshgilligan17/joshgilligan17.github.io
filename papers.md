Some of my recent projects

# Latent Diffusion for Antibody Design

Antigen specific CDR3 modeling using a classifier-free latent diffusion model and ESMFold embeddings. Read the paper [here](./papers/ESMDiff.pdf)


# Steering Small Language Models with Sparse Auto-Encoded Features
Identifying semantically meaningful activations in sparse reconstructions of latent embeddings of GPT2. We then demosntrate you can steer outputs without the need for finetuning by 
artificially boosting and supressing features Read the paper [here](./papers/sae_steering.pdf)
